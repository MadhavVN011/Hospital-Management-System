# Hospital-Management-System

A web-based Hospital Management System developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Python**. This project offers an intuitive interface and robust backend to manage hospital data, including patient records, appointments, and database maintenance.

##  Features

- **User Interface (HTML & CSS)**  
  Structured and responsive UI using HTML for layout and CSS for styling.

- **Backend (Python)**  
  A lightweight Python-driven backend (likely Flask-based) interfaces with an SQL database to manage hospital-related operations.

- **Database Integration**  
  SQL schema provided (`hms.sql`) for setting up tables like patients, doctors, appointments, etc.

##  Contents

- `PROJECT` – Main application source code  
- `hms.sql` – SQL database schema script  
- `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies and required packages

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x  
- A web framework (e.g., Flask) — install via `requirements.txt`  
- SQL database (e.g., SQLite, MySQL, or PostgreSQL)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MadhavVN011/Hospital-Management-System.git
   cd Hospital-Management-System
   
## Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Initialize the database:

Execute the hms.sql script in your SQL environment to create necessary tables and structure.

## Configure the application (if needed):

Modify any settings or configuration files inside the PROJECT folder (e.g., database paths or credentials).

## Run the application:

python PROJECT/app.py
(Replace app.py with the actual script filename.)

## Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 (or the configured port) to access the system.

## Usage

### Add, update, and retrieve patient, doctor, and appointment records.
### Perform basic hospital management tasks through a user-friendly interface.
### Customize UI and functionalities by editing HTML, CSS, or Python files as required.
